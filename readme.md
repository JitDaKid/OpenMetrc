# OpenMETRC

[METRC State &amp; Endpoint Coverage](src\OpenMetrc.Common\Data\MetrcEndpointsSummary.md)

## Development

There are several applications in this repo that aid in creating the final project.

### [OpenMETRC: Scraper](src/OpenMetrc.Scraper/readme.md)

Given a list of all possible states that METRC may be deployed do, scrape the documentation sites and compile a list (`state-summaries.json`) of all the states and the endpoints that they expose.

### [OpenMETRC: Common](src/OpenMetrc.Common/readme.md)

Given the `state-summaries.json` file and T4 templates, create a summary of the [ecosystem](src\OpenMetrc.Common\Data\MetrcEndpointsSummary.md) and the core Enums and state validator class for each endpoint.

### [OpenMETRC: Builder](src/OpenMetrc.Builder/readme.md)

This project is an OpenAPI spec builder for the METRC platform. This uses several helpers to ensure that all endpoints scraped in [OpenMETRC: Common](src/OpenMetrc.Common/readme.md) are mapped to controllers and endpoints with the appropriate return types and error structures. The final result of this tool is `open-metrc-swagger.yaml`. This file can use used by any platform for code generation. The main NuGet package is a wrapper for this file that adds some extra validation, error handling, and rate limiting features.

### [OpenMETRC: Builder Tests](tests/OpenMetrc.Builder.Tests/readme.md)

Used to test the OpenAPI spec that is generated by the builder app. This allows for a developer to test all endpoint for any and all states and companies they may have access too. This also allows testing against sandbox environments.

### [OpenMETRC](src/OpenMetrc/readme.md)

The core NuGet package and final product.

### [OpenMETRC Tests](tests/OpenMetrc.Tests/readme.md)

Tests for the main nuGet package.

# OpenMETRC: Builder

This project is an OpenAPI spec builder for the METRC platform. This uses several helpers to ensure that all endpoints scraped in [OpenMETRC: Common](src/OpenMetrc.Common/readme.md) are mapped to controllers and endpoints with the appropriate return types and error structures. The final result of this tool is `open-metrc-swagger.yaml`.

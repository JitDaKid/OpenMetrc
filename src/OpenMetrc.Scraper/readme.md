# OpenMETRC: Scraper

Since METRC is deployed separately to each state, and does not share a common code-base, this application is required to check to see which states have METRC installed as well as what sections and endpoints are configured. The results of which are stored in the `state-summaries.json` file at the root of the solution.

## Usage

This should only be used locally when testing to see if any new states have been added and if any new endpoints are configured.
